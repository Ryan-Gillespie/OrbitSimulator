# OrbitSimulator

A custom Orbital systems simulator created using Java with the JavaFX framework.

Origionally made in-between Astronomy and CS lectures, this project plots the trajectories of the planets of the solar system, as well as their moons in an interactive and highly visual fashion.

Orbital elements, excepting eccentricity, are phrased in terms of multiples of earth (i.e. earth mass units, astronaumical units, etc.)

## Controls

- Left/Right Arrow Keys: cycle through the planets. the current planet will always be at the center of the screen.
- Up/Down Arrow Keys: Time scale faster / slower.
- Spacebar: toggle lines connecting planets to their parent bodies.
- Enter: Toggle tracers that mark the paths of all orbiting bodies.
